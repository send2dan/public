# Introduction

Welcome to Dr. Daniel Weiand's Public GitHub Repository!

This repository includes presentations I’ve delivered (and the code used to deliver them), including: 
- an online workshop on Producing Parameterised Reports using purrr and Quarto; and 
- a plenary talk on Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance Rates (AMR) using R and Sharing the Results in the form of Parameterised Reports produced using Quarto.

# Why R?

R is a powerful, free, and open-source language for data science and statistics. This makes it a perfect tool for the NHS, where research, collaboration, and continuous quality improvement are paramount.

Open-source languages including R and Python are used in [many industries, including by Dell, Walmart and (increasingly) across the NHS](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration/)

# Information for anyone in the NHS who is interested in learning how to code:

- R is one of the most commonly used languages for data science, together with Python.
- It is a powerful, **entirely free** open source data science and statistics environment, used in industry, academia and major corporations (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Facebook).
- It benefits from a worldwide community that freely shares learning and resources, through e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/send2dan/)
- The [Goldacre report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067053/goldacre-review-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis.pdf) actively promotes the use of R in the NHS.
- [NUTH](https://www.newcastle-hospitals.nhs.uk/) now actively supports the use of R at scale, and it can be installed on **any work PC** (simply call IT and ask to be added the **“SCCM-R”** group)
- Great resources to learn how to code include:
  - [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/contact.html) delivers free-to-NHS-staff online introductory training on R and RStudio/Posit. It’s free to register. These courses are really popular and spaces are limited to about 20 per session. Sessions are scheduled once a month. For further information, please contact: [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net). 
  - Also see NHS-R community blog: <https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/>
  - There are also many (!) excellent, free textbooks (e.g. [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/))
  - NHS-R supports a thriving [Slack](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/) community, which is an excellent resource for when you get stuck (most useful if you are able to share a [reproducible example](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-create-one/5219) of the problem you're encountering)

# See what colleagues across the NHS are doing with code:

-   NHS-R and NHS.pycom run [the premier data science conference in the NHS](https://nhsrcommunity.com/contact.html), along with regular skill-based webinars 

-   The free-to-NHS conference is really of excellent quality, very well organised, and well attended: [Book your ticket](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events.html) to avoid disappointment!
