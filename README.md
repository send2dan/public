# Information for anyone in the NHS who is interested in learning how to code and/or keen to check out what colleagues across the NHS are doing with code:

R is one of the most commonly used languages for data science, together with Python.

   It is a powerful, free open source data science and statistics environment, used in industry, academia and major corporations (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Facebook).

   It benefits from a worldwide community that freely shares learning and resources, through e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/send2dan/)

   The [Goldacre report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067053/goldacre-review-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis.pdf) actively promotes the use of R in the NHS.

To learn how to code in R:

-   [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/about/) delivers [free-to-NHS-staff online introductory training on R and R Studio](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/#event_type-workshops). It’s free to register. These courses are really popular and spaces are limited to about 20 per session. Sessions are scheduled once a month. For further information, please contact: [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net). 

-   There are also many (!) excellent, free textbooks (e.g. [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/))

-   NHS-R supports a thriving [Slack](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/) community, which is an excellent resource for when you get stuck (most useful if you are able to share a [reproducible example](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-create-one/5219) of the problem you're encountering)

To see what colleagues across the NHS are doing with code:

-   NHS-R and NHS.pycom run [the premier data science conference in the NHS](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/#event_type-conferences), along with regular skill-based webinars 

-   The free-to-NHS conference is really of excellent quality, very well organised, and well attended: [Book your ticket](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/) to avoid disappointment!

-   You’re welcome to [check out my public GitHub code repository](https://github.com/send2dan/public), which includes presentations I’ve delivered (and the code used to deliver them), e.g. an [online workshop](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/nhs-r-nhs-pycom-online-conference-workshop-2023-producing-parameterised-reports-using-purrr-and-quarto/) on Producing Parameterised Reports using purrr and Quarto; and a [plenary talk](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/nhs-r-community-conference-2023-ticket-for-in-person-attendance-on-tuesday-17th-october-2023/) on Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance Rates (AMR) using R and Sharing the Results in the form of Parameterised Reports produced using Quarto. 

NUTH now actively supports the use of R at scale, and it can be installed on **any work PC** (simply call IT and ask to be added the **“SCCM-R”** group)
