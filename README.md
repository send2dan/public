# Introduction

Welcome to Dr. Daniel Weiand's Public GitHub Repository!

This repository includes presentations I’ve delivered (and the code used to deliver them), including: 
- an online workshop on Producing Parameterised Reports using purrr and Quarto; and 
- a plenary talk on Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance Rates (AMR) using R and Sharing the Results in the form of Parameterised Reports produced using Quarto.

# Information on R at NUTH

- [NUTH](https://www.newcastle-hospitals.nhs.uk/) now actively supports the use of R at scale, and it can be installed on **any work PC** (simply call IT on ext 21000 and ask to be added the **“SCCM-R”** group)

# Information on R and Python for staff working in the NHS

*Background information*

- R is one of the most commonly used languages for data science, together with Python.
- [Open-source (**free**)](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what-is-open-source/) data science programming languages, including R and Python, are used in [many industries, including by Dell, Walmart and (increasingly) across the NHS](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/inspiration/)
- Both R and Python benefit from a worldwide community that freely shares peer-reviewed learning and resources, e.g. through [GitHub](https://github.com/send2dan/), for anyone to use
- The [Goldacre report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067053/goldacre-review-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis.pdf) actively promotes the use of open-source data science programming languages across the NHS. This is with a view to increasing adoption of [RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipelines)](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/). The vision is for modern, open-source tools to support [better, broader, safer care](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis#modern-open-working-methods-for-nhs-data-analysis)
- [Lord Darzi's report on the state of the National Health Service in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-investigation-of-the-nhs-in-england) emphasises we are on the precipice of an artificial intelligence (AI) revolution that could transform care for patients.

*Resources*

- Great resources to learn how to code include:
  - [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/contact.html) delivers free-to-NHS-staff online introductory training on R and RStudio/Posit. It’s free to register. These courses are really popular and spaces are limited to about 20 per session. Sessions are scheduled once a month. For further information, please contact: [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net).
  - The NHS-R community also runs [the premier data science conference in the NHS](https://nhsrcommunity.com/contact.html), along with regular skill-based webinars.
  - Also see NHS-R community blog: <https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/>
  - There are also many (!) excellent, free textbooks (e.g. [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/))
  - NHS-R supports a thriving [Slack](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/) community, which is an excellent resource for when you get stuck (most useful if you are able to share a [reproducible example](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-create-one/5219) of the problem you're encountering)
